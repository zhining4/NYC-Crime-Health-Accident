However, in China where we come from, motorcycles are not allowed to drive on the streets since government believe motor vehicles are extremely vulnerable when accidents happen than cars. Thus, the death rate caused by collisions in China is far small compared with the U.S. We want to investigate about what factors like vehicle type, contribution vehicle factor, or others are truly related with the motorcycle accidents in New York City. At the same time, we are also curious about which district in New York City has the most motorcycle accidents like Brooklyn or Queen. We will try to find following questions relationship in order to answer 3 questions: How prevalent is collision in each borough? Will the borough caused the contributing vehicle factors behaved differently? Relation of the contributing factors or vehicle type code with the people get hurt in the collision.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Motor Vehicle Coliisions dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources We only have one dataset which is collected from the NYC OpenData which contains information that is collected and maintained by the City government. The reason why we choose the NYC openData is because we could directly get the data we are interested free without any additional operations and their data are real and reliable. Out dataset is the Motor Vehicle Collisions which contains details on the crash event and each row represents a motor crash event and the information about the crash reported from the engaged police. Since this dataset contains 31 columns and some columns are not that usefull for our analyze, we will do some preprocessing to the dataset and we will explain how we change the dataset in the cleaning section. For the following content, we will just explain what does each column represents. 2.1 Motor Vehicle Coliisions dataset 2.1.1 Location variables crash_date: Occurrence date of collision crash_time: Occurrence time of collision borough: Borough where collision occurred zip_code: Postal code of incident occurrence latitude: Latitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326) longitude: Longitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326) location: Latitude , Longitude pair on_street_name: Street on which the collision occurred cross_street_name: Nearest cross street to the collision off_street_name: Street address if known 2.1.2 Accident severity variables number_of_persons_injured: Number of persons injured number_of_persons_killed: Number of persons killed number_of_pedestrians_injured: Number of pedestrians injured number_of_pedestrians_killed: Number of pedestrians killed number_of_cyclist_injured: Number of cyclists injured number_of_cyclist_killed: Number of cyclists killed number_of_motorist_injured: Number of vehicle occupants injured number_of_motorist_killed: Number of vehicle occupants killed 2.1.3 Accident factor variables contributing_factor_vehicle_1: Factors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle contributing_factor_vehicle_2: Factors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle contributing_factor_vehicle_3: Factors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle contributing_factor_vehicle_4: Factors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle contributing_factor_vehicle_5: Factors contributing to the collision for designated vehicle collision_id:Unique record code generated by system.

Then we use the read.csv file to reload it into the data frame df. We could find and see that there are lots of missing values in the dataset therefore we need to carefully handle all these values. We first do some data cleaning. We could find that we have location column which is a pair of the latitude and longitude. Thus, we could simply drop the latitude and longitude to release some memories for our ram since this dataset is really big. Besides, we also choose the data from October to the most recent date to do the analysis since we only care about the general trend of collision with borough area and our ram is limited. 3.2 Feature Creation We create a new column called real_crash_date since when we find that we can not use the crash_date as the standard to distinguish whether this collision is what we want. Thus, we simply convert this column to another column called real_crash_date which is in the format of year-mon-date and then we could get the data from January to newest. 3.3 Data preprocessing As we said previously, we find that there are so many data that are missing but actually you will find that they are not truly missing. Take the contributing factor vehicle for example, we find that this dataset defines five columns for such factor. However, I believe no more than 95% collisions only up to 2 columns have specific content for this aspect and most collisions does not have more than 2 factors. Our missing value analysis will further evaluate why those values are missing in our dataset. For each collision, it must has at least one factor to cause it to happen. Thus, for the collisions that have at least one contributing factor, we fill 0 to avoid that our missing pattern in next section regarding them as missing values. But for collisions that all 5 factors are missing, we will keep them all as NA values which will be shown in the next missing values section. Similar reason for the vehicle type code. But for all the other columns, I simply keep them as NA if it is blank since they are truly missing. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Motorcycle Accident Missing Pattern", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Motorcycle Accident Missing Pattern We will focus on the motorcycle accident data to provide a clear missing pattern with explaination. We summarize this November-2021 data to provide a sufficient and recognizable missing pattern. For better understanding， I will explain significant missing variables there. Column Name Meaning vehicle_type_code_# the type of vehicle based on the selected vehicle category (ATV, bicycle, car/suv, ebike, escooter, truck/bus, motorcycle, other) contributing_factor_vehicle_# the factor contributing to the collision for designated vehicle on_street_name the street on which the collision occurred cross_street_name Nearest cross street to the collision off_street_name Street address if known After data cleaning, our most representative missing pattern now are accidents without having data lack of value for ‘cross_street_name’. As cross_street, on_street, and off_street are categorical variables that are not essential for our borough discussion, the column data value with lacking cross_street_name represent that most accidents occur on_street or has a specific street location in off_street. That means most motor accidents occurs on streets instead of road intersections. The second missing pattern of on_street and off_street represents all accidents that happends at road intersections. The third missing pattern are vehicle collisions happen with on_street location variable. That kind of accidents involves street like expressway that are not distributed to any borough or zipcode region. From column perspetive, we could see that most accidents do not have more than 2 vehicles. With on_street or off_street collision appear more often than cross_street collision. Column and row frequency shares similarity to provide the real accident phenomenon and tell us which type of accident appears more frequently. Missing pattern analysis provide sufficient details for what features most motorcycle collisions would have and what are other common features that motorcycle collisions shares sorting by pattern frequency. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 How prevalent is collision in each borough? 5.2 Will the borough caused the contributing vehicle factors behaved differently? 5.3 Relation of the contributing factors or vehicle type code with the people get hurt in the collision.", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 How prevalent is collision in each borough? We studied the occurrences of collision from October-01 to November-15 given by the data source. Then we have a first insight about the frequences of the collision in the total five borough in the New York city. From the graph, we could see that throught the whole time periods, the frequency stay significantly high for all these five borough. That means we cannot specify the relationship between borough and collision occurence from this step. Also, there is not convex in all these five graphs which means that collision is a non-neglectable factors that threats our life. Then we create a ridge graph below to see if we can find a clear comparison among all five borough in a single graph. In the ridge graph, only staten island has some occasionally date contains more accidents than average. All five borough frequency of collision is still in a mild and general trend which means the average case per location is consistent through all dates. There is no clear difference in terms of the number of collisions happened within each borough since we both believe that maybe mahattan will have more collision than other borough depending on intense level of traffic density. That could also means that traffic density is not directly related to the occurence of motor accident occurence. There could be reasons like, high traffic density induce the congestion time and decrease the average driving speed. That results in a low possibility for collision. Another possible reason is people who prefer to ride motor than car choose to take subway in companion with intense traffic density. Then we could focus down to find are there specific region within each borough are significant that we could be aware of those region for collision occurence. We could then check through within each borough, corresponding to the total amount of occurence, which region represents by the zip_code would be representative data. We divided the count by the total occurences and generate the top 5 region that has the most percentage occurence within each borough. By comparison, brooklyn has the highest collision rate region compare to other zip code region within brooklyn. That means when people stay in brooklyn, people can try to avoid go to those region as comparatively other region within brooklyn are safer. We could see most borough does not have a significant region while brooklyn and manhattan both have one that has most occurences further from others. In brooklyn, the region with zip code 11207 and in manhattan, the region with zip code 10002 are representative region within each borough. We could also conclude that people could take more precaution when going to those place as they have motor accidents much more often than others. 5.2 Will the borough caused the contributing vehicle factors behaved differently? Before doing the analysis of the potential patterns hidden between the different borough and different contribution factors, we need to first do some revisement on the original dataset since we know that for each collison, they might have more than 1 contributing vehicle factors. Thus, we could not simply just used the single column like contributing_vehicle_1to plot the graph. What we did is just creating a new row with same information but replace the contributing_vehicle_1 with contributing_vehicle_2, contributing_vehicle_3, and etc if these values existr. Then we could create the dot plot graph for the top30 contributing factors for the whole New York city which is the graph below. However, this plot may also include the cases where the borough are missing. From the plot, the dot plot for the top30 contributing vehicle factors in New York City, we could clearly say that the unspecified contributing factors exceeds other contributing factors far away. We think that this phenomenon is attributed to the reason that it is impossible for the police to witness the collision by themselves and usually people will argue about the responsibilities of the collision. Thus it is hard to police to clearly state the contributing factors clearly and they will simply use unspecified to be the contributing factors. And we could also know that the distraction, failure to the right-way, and following too closely are the three other dominant factors to contribute the collision other than the unspecified which is not surprised since people usually will make mistakes on these aspects. But one interesting pattern is that only a small fraction of collision are caused by the alcohol investment but alcohol culture has been deeply rooted in U.S. . However, alcohol investment are the main factor to cause the collision in China which we could see that Americans are more likely still obey the rules even they got drunk. Let us focus our attention back to the hidden relationship between borough and contributing factors since from the above graph, we know nothing about borough. We create a new graph above to see how contributing factors behave in different borough and how they behave differently compared with the graph representing the whole New York City. We could clearly see that these contribution factors behave similar with the graph representing the collision cases in the whole New York City since the order of these contributing factors are the same and dots follows the similar trends from the overall aspect.In general, each borough factors are in the order of the occurence of accidents in ther increasing order where Staten Island has least frequency. Besides, we could also see that the dots representing the borough will basically clustered together in the same row except Unspecified and Driving distraction which further proves that the borough might not exist a relationship between the borough and the contributing factors. As for the unspecified, these five borough are separte but as for driving distraction, Queen, Mahattan, and Brooklynforms a group and Bronx and Staten Island forms another group. We know that the streets are closed and narrow sometimes in Queen, Mahattan, and Brooklyn which might caused the driving distraction. But from the overall aspect, we do not think there is a clear relationship between borough and the contributing factors. 5.3 Relation of the contributing factors or vehicle type code with the people get hurt in the collision. For this question, we want to investigate whether there is a relationship between the contributing vehicle factors and the people that got injured during the collision or a relationship between the vehicle type that got involved and the people that got injured during the collision. At first, we want to split the cases of people got injured and people got killed separately but we find that the cases of people got killed during the collision are really small. Thus, it is really hard to detect some relationship from the graph for the killed cases. We simply combine the sum of cases of people got injured and killed as case hurt to see more general relationship between severity and contributing factors. Then we plot two graph below to show the whether the hidden relationship exist or not. Before analyzing the graph above, we need to do some predictions and revisement for the dataset. Since we want to investigate the relationship between contributing factors and the people got hurt during the collision, we first filter the data frame by only caring about the occurrences of contributing factors which is larger than 100. Then we classify these factors as three dangerous levels of driving behavior. These three levels are severe, normal and moderate and we first classify the severe behavior according to the top 10 most dangerous driving habits from Brandon Myers(March, 2021). Then for the rest factors, if it is directly correlated with drivers themselves, we classify it as normal. Otherwise, we define it as moderate since these factors are out of your control like the factor Other Vehicles. Then, we made some assumption. Both of us think that the number of people got injured during collision should be positively correlated with the level of behavior status. Since the more danger behavior, the more people might got involved in this collision. For example, got drunk during driving is definitely a risky behavior and we usually see that Drunk driving will causes several people got hurt or even killed. Thus, we made the assumption that behavior level is positively correlated with the number of people got hurt in collision. However, things do not happen from the truth. What reflected on the graph is not in the same case. We could see from the graph that the deep red represent the severe behavior but it gradually decreased as the number of people got injured increases. Although the fluctuation is not large, the trend is really clear which is kind of confusing. And we could also see that the normal and moderate are positively causing more people to get involved in the collision which might caused by the coincidence since the cases are really small. Thus, from the graph, we think the truth from the graph contradicts our assumption. But we are questioning that maybe risky behavior are more lethal than normal and moderate behavior but since we have fewer data that has people got killed, we can not get a precise conclusion here and maybe we will investigate and discuss it in the future. For now, let us focus on the relationship between vehicle type and the number of people got injured in the collision. As we did similarly in the previous graph, for the vehicle type part, we also filter the data frame if the occurrences of vehicle type is more than 50 and we classify the type of vehicle as “car”, “truck” and “mini”. Let us explain the type of car a little bit here: Column Name Represents for “car” both the automobile and the cart which are used for carrying people “truck” those large trucks for delivering goods “mini” smaller transportation tools like bike and motorcycle We both believe that the larger the vehicle type, the more people got involved in this collision since like if the truck rollover on the road or highway, it is really easy to attack nearby cars or the nearby people which causes more people to get involved. Thus, we think if the vehicle size increases, more people that got hurt will get involved which means they are positively correlated. However, the fact that we got from the graph contradicts our assumption again. We could clearly see from the graph that the dark blue representing the truck is slowly decreasing as hurt increases. This happened same to the auto and the mini group. However the mini increases significantly when the hurt is 1 and 2. We think the reason behind this is the prevalence of motorcycle in the U.S and if the motorcycle rollolver, both people on the motorcycle will get injured. But we could still see from the whole graph that the auto still occupies the biggest part. In a word, from this graph, the pattern is not that clear so that we can not make a concrete conclusion about the postive relationship between size of vehicle and the number of people got hurt during collision. However, we think the data on the graph reflects that they are negatively correlated but more evidence is needed. Reference: Brandon Myers is a Drivers Education and Safe Driving enthusiast.

"],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Accidents occurence percentage during different time period within a day morning noon afternoon evening midnight Each time period formed by conventional separation of a day in the following format: Time Period Time Span morning 5:00 - 10:00 noon 10:00 - 14:00 afternoon 14:00 - 18:00 evening 18:00 - 22:00 midnight 22:00 - 5:00 This interactive plot allow us to observe what the percentage frequency of accidents occur during different time period within a day. We use the percentage instead of count directly to avoid some value in graph to be too obvious due to a single special date. This graph is in purpose of showing how different time period contribute to the likelihood of having the accidents. Percentage frequency provide the direct relationship we want to focus in this question. After interact with the graph, we could see the frequency descending in that order: morning, afternoon, noon, evening, midnight. Where data between noon and evening is on average at same percentage contribution. We could see that even midnight has the longest time period division, midnight has the least percentage of accidents occurence corresponding to the real world. There is no significant strange data from the graph represents motor accidents have special features. As transportation is in high volume for morning and afternoon, then middle volume for noon and evening, low volume in midnight, the motor accidents follows the traffic density of daily life. We can conclude that there is no instruction about when is safe to ride motor cycle outside without further investigate into specific location and the traffic density in each borough at given time period. We still need more data to provide any useful instructions to avoid motor accidents by time period. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Valuable results 7.2 Data Limitation 7.3 Future direction 7.4 Project invokes", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Valuable results There are several meaningful ideas we have analyzed through our data visualization. The NYC motor collision is prevalent through all borough and there are regions like zipcode 11207 and 10002 that has comparatively higher motor collision rate than other places within each borough. People could pay more attention when walking or driving within those areas if they live in Brooklyn or Manhattan and in general people should obey the traffic rule and be careful for walking across street. We have also found that there is no relationship between borough and accident contribution factors. None of the factors are significant in specific borough, so we can conclude that accident occurence reason has no regional effects. The last mosaic visualization provide the evidence that there is no positive relationship between accident reason severity and the number of people get hurt in the accident, but we are questioning that the severity of the driving behavior is positively correlated with the lethal rate of the collision . Besides, the size of the vehicle is also not positively correlated with the number of people that gor hurt in the collision. We cannot infer how many people get injured or killed in the collision by the vehicle type involved in the collision. But we are think they are negatively correlated and more data is needed to prove it 7.2 Data Limitation Our data set received are comprehensive to include all accidents, but lacking accident details. There are huge number of na in each columns and we need to simulate those variables to give meaningful representation. That causes the data we could evaluate are not sufficient and many observation will include the unspecified or unknown for high occurence. Also, for question like injury and killed cases. There is no enough data to provide a general trends. We do not want to have high cases in accidents but for this data set, if could be better for us to analysis if each accident contains necessary details. 7.3 Future direction Though there is no significant relationship between the factors we focus and the collision rate to give a comprehensive guideline for pedestrian or drivers, our results are still meaningful in current steps with this data. We simply combine people hurt and killed in same varible, when we separate those as different level of severity, we can find is there any severity driving habit causes more people killed than injured. When data contains more details that problem could be more valuable and we can give a clearly relationship and investigation on it. Also, the current investigation on borough is on general region, a better use could be represent those zipcode regional accidents rate in a map when data are large and there could be better separation on the frequency density among regions. 7.4 Project invokes This project gives us a better understanding of motor accident factors. There are relationships that we thought in general thoughts are wrong which means accident severity is also not single variable related. We could use different data visualization to focus on different problems. Correct usage of visualization type on each question are audience friendly and representative. Each step of the project is essential part to analyse real world problem and tell audience what we find.
